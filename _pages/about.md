I am currently in the final year of my M.S. program at Liaoning University. I have previously been a visiting student at HKUST-GZ under the supervision of Dr. Bingzhuo Zhong, and at Peking University under the supervision of Dr. Hao Tang. I am now a research intern at vivo Co., Ltd. and the University of California, Merced, working under the supervision of Dr. Yiwei Wang.

My research interests include NLP, multimodal LLMs, human-like models, computer vision, Diffusion Models on T2I, Diffusion Models on LLM, efficient training and inference, multimedia quality assessment, controllable T2I, AIGC, world model, etc.
