🚨 New Paper Alert 🚨

**SemVink: Advancing VLMs’ Semantic Understanding of Optical Illusions via Visual Global Thinking**

Vision-Language Models (VLMs) excel in many semantic tasks, yet fail at a fundamental human ability: detecting hidden content in optical illusions and AI-generated images.

🔍 We introduce **HC-Bench**, a benchmark of 112 hidden-content images (texts & objects), showing state-of-the-art VLMs achieve only **0–5.36% accuracy**—even with explicit prompting.

✨ Our solution, **SemVink (Semantic Visual Thinking)**, is surprisingly simple: scaling images down to **32–128 px**. This “zoom-out” operation boosts performance to **over 99% accuracy** across leading VLMs, bridging computational vision with human-like perception.

🌍 Implications: Our findings expose a fundamental architectural flaw in current VLMs and call for **multi-scale, hybrid models**—critical for applications in **medical imaging, security, and real-world robust AI**.
